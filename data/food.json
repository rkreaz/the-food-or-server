Fatty tuna, which comes from the belly section of bluefin tuna, is another popular topping.A couple of notable exceptions to the almost always raw statement include shrimp nigiri, which features shrimp that has been boiled and butterflied, and eel nigiri, which consists of a mound of sushi rice with a strip of grilled eel on top."

Sushi etiquette is another extensive topic that we can't fully explore here, but in general, nigiri should be dipped in the soy sauce so that the fish, not the rice, is immersed, and eaten upside down, with the fish against your tongue."
